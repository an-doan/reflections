1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, you create a a repository inside the folder you are currently
in. This means there is a .git folder inside you folder and you can now keep track of the 
history of the files inside your folder. You need to do this so that you can track changes in
your files. 

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value
do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory and the repository because it decides
which files will be commited. The working directory has all the files and contains the repository,
and the repository contains the commits. With the staging area, you can choose which files to commit, 
so that is what it offers.
