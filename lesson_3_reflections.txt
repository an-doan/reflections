1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local when you want to share you work with others so that they can also change code and make commits to the repository.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might want to always pull changes manually because someone else might make a commit that you don't want in your local repository because its buggy, so pulling changes manually allows you to choose which changes you want to pull.
